# Scrum

> From https://twitter.com/adrianh/status/923966644485066753

We don't do Scrum internally. I'm not that big a fan of Scrum (especially the certification industry built up around it). That saidâ€¦

1. Scrum doesn't say you have to say "As an X I want to Y because Z".
Scrum doesn't say you can only release once a Sprint.

2. Scrum isn't an acronym and isn't spelt SCRUM.
Scrum doesn't say the sprint and product backlogs need to contain the same kind of things.

3. Scrum doesn't say you have to have burn down or burn up charts.

4. Scrum doesn't say you have to wait until the sprint review to show people things.

5. Scrum doesn't say you have to wait until the sprint retrospective to talk about problems.

6. Scrum doesn't say you have to estimate backlog items.
Scrum doesn't say you have to have points.

7. Scrum doesn't say you have to track velocity.
Scrum doesn't say you have to have epics, stories, and tasks.

8. Scrum doesn't say it's the only way to be Agile.

9. Scrum doesn't say the PO gets to tell the team how to turn the backlog into releasable code.

10. Scrum doesn't say that the SM gets to tell the team how to turn the backlog into releasable code.

11. Scrum doesn't say operations people cannot be on the team.
Scrum doesn't say testers cannot be on the team.

12. Scrum doesn't say designers or user researchers cannot be on the team.

13. Scrum doesn't say the PO has to make all the decisions by themselves.

14. Scrum doesn't say that the PO needs to prioritise the whole product backlog.

15. Scrum does not say you must work an 80hour week to meet the forecast you made at the start of the sprint.
