# Open Source in the Workplace

## Motivations

Diving in, for me a well-defined open source policy has quite a lot of value. I find that open source is the de facto "programmers association":

1. Public forum motivates my best work
2. Outside feedback keeps my perspective honest
3. Community involvement exercises my empathy muscles
4. Collaboration across the stranger and remote barriers surfaces best practices and creative thinking


These features translate into benefits in the work place:

1. Best work impacts the level of job work
2. Job tasks have less chance of inducing tunnel vision
3. Empathy is applied to the job workplace
4. A flow of best practices and creative thinking coming in from the outside


So while an hour of open source work is often an hour taken away from job work, the orthogonal forces created can have a significant impact on the quality and efficiency of the scalar job tasks.


Finally, some potential benefits the business can leverage from an open source initiative/values:

1. Talent source
2. Attract higher level talent
3. Marketing bullet point

4. Code to open source has SOME of the following characteristics:

	- highly reusable
	- company domain specific intended to be used by clients
	- demos
	- documentation
	- templates
	- tooling
	- plugins to other open source
	- wrappers around other open source
	- integrations to open source


5. Code NOT to open source has ANY of the following characteristics:

	- proprietary algorithm
	- internal processes
	- proprietary products
	- below-average code
	- not documented
	- not easy to on-board and setup
